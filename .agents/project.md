# Project Context

FlClash is a multi-platform proxy client based on ClashMeta (mihomo), built with Flutter. It supports Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux, using a Material You design with Surfboard-like UI.

## Version Notes

- Release CI pins Flutter 3.44.8. Local SDK may diverge, so trust the CI
  version as the source of truth for release builds.
- Release CI pins the Go compiler to 1.26.8 independently of the minimum Go language version in `core/go.mod`.
- Dart SDK constraint: `>=3.8.0 <4.0.0`.
